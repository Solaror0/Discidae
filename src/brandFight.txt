Strategy/Mechanics:

If you don't want to straight up look at the choices needed, the strategy is fairly simple.
Each message detailing Brand's attack, as well as the holy sword message, will 
give hints as to what choice to pick. 

E.g, if his knife is held in the left hand, it means that its on your right. Therefore,
attacking from the right is not a good idea.

Most wrong decisions in the fight lead to death. 
The first decision (the desk throw), leads to either death, a harder fight, or a normal fight.


Choices:

- Choose to go slide under the desk
- Do not choose to thrust at Brand
- Stab his stomach

or

- Choose to block the desk
- Do not choose anything related to flames
- Do not pick up the knife
