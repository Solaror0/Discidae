DISCIDAE

About + Disclaimer:

This game is about a student entering the next day of school. Although they soon realize that a few things are off.

The main plot revolves around 3 characters!

The disclaimer is that it is hard to switch a characters behaviour in the gap of 1 or 2 scenes, so it turns out to be abrupt and kind of cringe... also to make the plot easy to write I chose a simple concept of demons which adds to cringe sometimes.
