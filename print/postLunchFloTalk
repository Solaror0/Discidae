After eating lunch and walking for a little I would start heading to class. With a few detours of course, no need to be too early.

I was thinking of what Flo said earlier.. she was acting a little weird wasn't she?
pressEnter
YELLOW  Is he over here?  RESET
I heard a small voice and humming, it was Flo of course. Not long after she would enter my vision at the end of the hallway.

YELLOW
Oh, you are  RESET
"You're not in class either?" I'd ask the obvious.
pressEnter
YELLOW  Well obviously not, I told you I'd see you later right? Here I am!  YELLOW
Flo would make a mock superhero pose here. Yeah, she was definitely hyper.. or something.

YELLOW  Hey, you smell too you know. Not what I'm used to though.  RESET  "Well thanks." I'd respond dryly, about to ask Flo if she was okay.

pressEnter
Before I could ask though, she started.  YELLOW  This is going to feel a little random to you, but have you ever heard of Malicious Spirits?  RESET
pressEnter
YELLOW  They're these things that assume human form and live mostly human lives. Although their main purpose is to consume mass quantities of souls  RESET
pressEnter
YELLOW  If you were lucky, you met the other ones in this school first. Ms Dodds and Principal Brand.
That might have made this explanation less janky? Yeah.
 That would've been all, you would've been left to your own devices until the end.

 But there are always counterbalances to us spirits. And humans that can contract with those counterbalances.  RESET

pressEnter
YELLOW  Your sense of smell was a small giveaway, but in the end it is what it is.
pressEnter
It's not like I was silent while Flo was talking, actually I was asking a bunch of questions.

 This felt like a really dumb prank. But like any joke, there was that crawling suspicion that it was real.

And then feeling stupid about even considering it to be anything but a joke. In any case, she just kept yapping.

pressEnter
PURPLE  Flo is attacking you!  RESET
The hallway was completely scarce, which was rare even during classtime.

And all I saw was a expressionless Flo running towards me, before throwing a fist at me.

 I yelped, ducking on instinct, and barely dodged it. And where the fist landed I saw small cracks on the wall.

pressEnter
She didnt give me time to ask questions though, it came coming, each faster than the other.
 Although she was clearly letting me dodge.
