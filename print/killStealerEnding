Not making my way to Flo, I start to run towards the altar's location.
pressEnter
As I run through the hallways, almost there. I catch a glimpse of Flo.
She notices me too, and probably realizes I'm running once I don't slow down.
pressEnter
Fear instantly crawls up my stomach, threatening my breath.
But I practically throw myself into the room and slam the door.

pressEnter
This is not the time to fumble for the key.
With shaking hands I manage to hold it, shoving it
into the back of the closet. And suddenly I'm in a small
room with dark blue lighting.
pressEnter
Behind me is a stone altar of three people, kneeling and holding onto a key.
pressEnter
Not too long after, I hear someone running into the room, laughing.
But I could basically see the smile turning into a frown
and the laugh turning into a screen.
pressEnter
The scratching and fists last a long time, but they eventually disappear
And even longer than that, I wait.
pressEnter
At some point, I was outside the altar. The knife dissolved away, leaving a gem.
Presumably with them inside.
