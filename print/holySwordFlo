BLUE  You are entering battle. This battle is best presented in turn-based combat.
You will have two options before Flo attacks, and two options after she attacks.

 Attacking rolls out of 5, the holy sword gives you a 2 bonus.
 Waiting makes your next attack roll out of 12

 Blocking rolls out of 10, you divide that by 2 and add the holy sword bonus. Whatever you get is subtracted from Flo's attack.

Dodging rolls out of 5. If it's higher than Flo's roll, you dodge. If not, you get hit with full force.
