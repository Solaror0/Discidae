Whatever was controlling my body didn't even let me shout. With a step to the right I bring the sword down
but he didn't even have to move to block it.Immediately after, his hand turns into a blur,
and I feel a line drawn on my stomach.

Thankfully I had moved back on instinct, so it wasn't deep
But for someone who went from no-lines-drawn to more-than-no-lines-drawn
on their stomach in just a few minutes..it hurt.
