At the last moment, I dodge to the left and raise the sword. Between the stomach and arm, the stomach would hurt more right?
I plunge the sword into his stomach and twist. It gets to know Brand in every way. Entrance, indoors, and exit
Clearly, Brand wasn't expecting this either because his eyes open wide. Strangely enough, there's no blood. PG-friendly I guess?
After a few steps back, he quite literally starts to crumble. I mean turn to dust, which also disappears.
The only thing left of him is a small key. I just killed my principal. Bruh?
