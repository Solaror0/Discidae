RESETI had chosen Ahmed first. First, I had to make way to his classroom.
pressEnter
He had... Physics right now? I walked to the classroom and it was fairly easy to spot him.
pressEnter
Luckily, they had a work period right now. The knife worked as promised, I was unnoticed by most.
Most, except Ahmed. He'd turn around me and look at me for a bit.
pressEnter
We were never friends or anything, just good acquaintances.
In any case, I had to go talk to him.
pressEnter
Striking up some random conversation, he asked me why I was here.
His tone carried some confusion. As in "why're you talking to me?"
I told him I was just roaming around and didn't want to go to class.
pressEnter
Some fear built up in me, to do what I was supposed to do after all.
There was a bigger fear though, what would happen If I didn't.
pressEnter
He wouldn't even have time to be confused.
Which is a little cruel when your classmate comes up and snatches your soul.
Or maybe he'd still be alive, just in the knife.
pressEnter
I tapped the knife on his shoulder before he could realize it, and suddenly
he was motionless.

Now for the other two.
