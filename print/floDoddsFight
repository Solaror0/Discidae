Hmm, should I even go to my next class? I mean, there's kind of a bigger problem right now. My teacher just tried to kill me?

I thought about going to the office and reporting it.. but who would believe me?
 At least It was a blessing that my thoughts were kept calm by the holy sword.
As I roamed the hallways I see Flo come out of a corner, she looks at me with a bit of surprise in her eyes.

YELLOW  You're not in class either?  RESET   She'd grin  YELLOW

Well, I needed to talk to you anyway. You didn't meet me at lunch.

pressEnter
I didn't reply, too focused on something else.
  YELLOW  You know, you seem different today. Smell different? Like how you said I smelt like perfume.

Her speech was becoming a little more erratic, almost stilted.
pressEnter
YELLOW  Have you ever heard of Malicious Spirits?  RESET
 I shook my head.  YELLOW

They're these grotesque little things that take human form. They have to consume mass quantities of souls once in a while to survive.  RESET

pressEnter
YELLOW  You already realized didn't you? You got Dodds  RESET

 The issue was.. I had realized nothing. First my teacher turns into a demon and attacks me.
 Next, my best friend.. or something like that, admits to knowing about it?
