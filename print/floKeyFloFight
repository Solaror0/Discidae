After some study of both the key's information and the holy sword I had learned a few things.

1. Flo was a both malicious spirit working together with two others. Basically, demons?

 2. The school is enclosed via spicy demon magic, no exit allowed under threat of death. To unlock it, I'll need the other key.
 But only i can leave.

 3. Their goal is to do something with whoever is inside the school.

 4. There's two more. Mrs. Dodds and Principal Brand.. my english teacher and principal..

 5. For now? The holy sword would help me complete whatever was needed. As in, by controlling my body mentally.
 I wouldn't even feel the need to protest.



BLUE  Choose: fight Brand or Dodds. There is no other option.
 A. Fight Dodds
 B. Fight Brand  RESET
