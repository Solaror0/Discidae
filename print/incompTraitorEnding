Not making my way to Flo, I start to run somewhere, anywhere.

As I run through the hallways, almost there. I catch a glimpse of Flo.
She notices me too, and probably realizes I'm running once I don't slow down.
pressEnter
Fear instantly crawls up my stomach, threatening my breath.
But I practically throw myself into a room and slam the door.
Maybe this time, I could beat her in a fight?
pressEnter
The sounds at the door start and then they stop.
After some while, I approach it carefully.
pressEnter
It was a mistake.
I eat splinters and wood digging into my skin.
