 I was roaming the hallways for a little before going to my next class. No need to be so early after all. And I had managed to be near my English classroom.

Of course, Ms. Dodds doesn't like me, she made that clear enough. So I try to walk especially fast by...
YELLOW  HEY!!  RESET  It was too late.
pressEnter
YELLOW  Come here! Are you being late to yet another class?  RESET

Immediately I had been dragged into her classroom. Great scolding, but wouldn't this make me even more late?
pressEnter
"I was heading there Ms. Dodds I promise, I was just a little delayed from lunch."
pressEnter
YELLOW  I swear I will get you out of this school. Do you understand me?  RESET
 As she spoke her harsh perfume sent became unbearably strong, forcing me to scrunch my nose for just a second.


 It wouldn't go unnoticed by her though. Causing her to raise an eyebrow.  RESET
pressEnter
YELLOW  Oh? You smell that don't you?  RESET
 "Huh?" I'd ask, her demeanour had changed so suddenly.

  YELLOW  Hm. I guess it was only a matter of time before we found more kids like you.  RESET
pressEnter
As she spoke her pupils would slowly contract. Her skin, the wrinkled
 mess it usually was, started to become unnaturally smooth, almost like porcelain.
YELLOW  "Ms. Dodd's? You okay there?"  RESET
 At this point I had started to back off, but the door was closed. Great.
