RESETI chose to live. I was forced to. I mean, choose to die? Why would I ever do that.
Would I have to kill.. the other students?
Flo explained it to me before leaving me still sitting on the ground.

I would have to .. brainstorm basically, and find the other three students.

Then, she gave me a knife. I wouldn't stab them, but the knife would siphon their soul upon contact.
The knife would also help me stay relatively unnnoticed.
It would restrain my moral urges, great.

After I gave the souls to her, her and the other spirits would be able to set their final ritual off.
Something to do with the whole school.

Before she left though, she shoved something in my mouth. Told me it would keep me calm.

Half an hour passed as I brainstormed.

It was less going through each person and more following a mental trail that
 already existed.. according to Flo.

 Apparently it was similar to how I started smelling out their demon-ness.

 It didn't take me long, I had my names. Cleo, Ahmed, and Cameron.
