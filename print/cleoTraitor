RESETI had chosen Cleo first. First, I had to make way to her classroom.
pressEnter
She had.. Chemistry right now? I walked to the classroom and it was fairly easy to spot her.
pressEnter
Luckily, they had a work period right now. The knife worked as promised, I was unnoticed by most.
Most, except Cleo. She'd turn around me and look at me for a bit.
pressEnter
We were never friends or anything, just good acquaintances.
In any case, I had to go talk to her.
pressEnter
Striking up some random conversation, she asked me why I was here.
Her tone carried some confusion. As in "why're you talking to me?"
I told her I was just roaming around and didn't want to go to class.
pressEnter
Some fear built up in me, to do what I was supposed to do after all.
There was a bigger fear though, what would happen If I didn't.
pressEnter
She wouldn't even have time to be confused.
Which is a little cruel when your classmate comes up and snatches your soul.
Or maybe she'd still be alive, just in the knife.
pressEnter
I tapped the knife on her shoulder before she could realize it, and suddenly
she was motionless.

Now for the other two.
