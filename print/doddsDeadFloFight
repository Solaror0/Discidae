 3. Their goal is to do something with whoever is inside the school.

 4. There's one more, my principal?

 5. For now? The holy sword would help me complete whatever was needed. As in, by controlling my body mentally.
 I wouldn't even feel the need to protest.

In fact, I was in front of Brand's office right now.

BLUE  You make your way to the office area. The next culprit is Principal Brand


 Principal Brand was a tall man, with the demeanour of being overly competent but not haughty about it.
 He was generally personable, although your interaction with him may not reflect that this time.

As soon as he saw you he squinted at you for half a second.

 Brand speaks familiarly YELLOWNot in class? Is everything okay?RESET

BLUE  You affirm so, and while doing so Brand has noticed something about you. Probably the stench of Dodds and Flo  RESET
