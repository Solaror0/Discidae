This time, I dodge to the right. Brand's grip meets the wall and cracks it,
but I'm too busy swinging the sword at his arm to notice. Please cut.
YELLOWNot bad!RESET
As if physical, the fire blocks the sword and pushes me out of balance.
immediately taking advantage of this Brand swivels and kicks at my face, sending me flying into the desk from before.
I can't describe what happened in between, because I didn't see it.
But I found myself amongst broken wood and splinters while my vision faded
